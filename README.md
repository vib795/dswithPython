# Data Structures with Python

## Implemetation by [Utkarsh Singh](https://www.singhutkarsh.com/)

#### We go over the top 10 algorithms/coding concepts that are a must know before a technical interview:
1. Depth first search. 
2. Breadth first search.
3. Matching parentheses problem (or a vairation of this.)
4. Using hash tables (e.g. manipulating 2D lists like in the best average problem. Memoization/caching problems).
5. Manipulating multiple variables or pointers at a time (linked list problems, longest pallindromic sub-string in a string).
6. Reversing a linked list - it's implementation in some way.
7. Sorting fundamentals (general understanding of time and space complexities. Know run times of different algorithms).
8. Recursion.
9. Custom/agumented data structures (OOP concepts).
10. Binary search (implementation).
